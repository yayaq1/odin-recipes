<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Chicken Biryani is a savory chicken and rice dish that includes layers of chicken, rice, and aromatics that are steamed together. The bottom layer of rice absorbs all the chicken juices as it cooks, giving it a tender texture and rich flavor, while the top layer of rice turns out white and fluffy.<br><br>The chicken is marinated in a mixture of yogurt and spices, which helps to tenderize the meat and infuse it with flavor. The rice is flavored with a mixture of whole spices, which are removed before serving, and saffron, which gives the rice a beautiful yellow color.<br>The biryani is garnished with fried onions, fresh cilantro, and mint leaves, which add a fresh, bright flavor to the dish.</p>
